Simple AppleScript to set your Messages status to the current track in Rdio.  The script checks every 10 seconds if there has been an update.  If Rdio and/or Messages shuts down, the script will end.  

If you pause or stop Rdio, your Messages status will be set to Available.  This also happens if Rdio is shut down but Messages is still running.

I'm currently using Alfred to run the script, but you could save the script as a stand alone application or run it from the OS X script menu.
